# Design Basics

## Intro

The Reentry Guide app is designed to be as inclusive as possible. Many former incarcerated individuals may have never used a smartphone and could have brain injuries or chronic diseases. Therefore, we are not designing the app for advanced users like those who use Arch Linux. Instead, we are making the app so simple that even a 4-year-old can easily operate and understand it.

## Key Principles

### Simplicity

Keep the design straightforward and intuitive. Avoid unnecessary complexity to ensure that users of all ages and abilities can easily navigate the app.

### Accessibility

Ensure that the app is accessible to users with various disabilities. 

### Consistency

Maintain a consistent design language throughout the app. Consistency helps users learn and navigate the app more easily, creating a seamless experience.
